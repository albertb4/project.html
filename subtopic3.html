               This source is an article by Rafael Abreu about the history of IMAX technology and how it helped change the way movies are made forever. Abreu first discusses some of the key characteristics of IMAX technology: heavier, noisier camera, horizontal film stock, and higher resolution on the cameras. Abreu then goes into detail about the history of IMAX and how it came to be, starting in 1967 with the first IMAX theater debuting in 1974. IMAX was mostly used for documentary filmmaking until the late 2000s when Christopher Nolan shot multiple scenes of The Dark Knight on IMAX cameras. To this day, IMAX has become a fixture of modern film.
