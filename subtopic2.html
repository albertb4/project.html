                This source is a brief description of early developments of sound technology in film from the Modern Museum of Art. The source discusses two ways in which films were able to include sound in the late 1920s and early 1930s: sound-on-disc and sound-on-film. Sound-on-disc was a method in which dialogue and music were recorded on a separate record and played in conjunction with the film during a showing. By the early 1930s, sound-on-disc was replaced by sound on film in which sound recordings were inscribed to the film itself so that sound could be heard while the movie was playing. This allowed for audiences to hear dialogue in movies for the first time.

                This source, from Stikky Media, is a timeline of the history of Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) in movies starting in 1958. The first instance of CGI in a movie was the 1958 film, Vertigo, directed by Alfred Hitchcock. However, CGI was only used in the opening credits. The first film to actually use CGI within the main storyline was Westworld in 1973. The process was very laborious given limited access to computers and lack of technology available at the time. However, as technology continued to evolve, by the 1990s CGI became a fixture of all different kinds of movies. These days, almost every single film put out has some element of CGI in it's design.
