            <td> This article by Barbara Flueckiger contains information about Kinemacolor, the earliest technology that existed for bringing color to movies. Flueckiger explains how Kinemacolor first rose to prominence in 1908 after being created by George Albert Smith and Charles Urban at The Natural Color Kinematograph Company Ltd. Furthermore, she goes into detail about how the technology actually worked. Kinemacolor was an addative process, meaning it could only add color to a film after it had already been shot. The device would be placed in front of the projector and alternate between red and green filters throughout the showing to make it appear as if the film had been recorded with color.

                This is an article from the encyclopedia Britannica that provides information about the Cinematograph, one of the earliest film technologies to ever exist. The article discusses how the device was created by French filmmakers and inventors Auguste and Louis Lumière. The article states that the device was a much more lightweight and portable version of it's predecessor, the kinetoscope and could actually function as a camera rather than a viewing device. It also talks about how the Lumières primarily used the device to film short documentaries called "actualities", almost always shot outdoors. The Cinematograph was a revolutionary device that laid the groundwork for further advancement in the film industry.
